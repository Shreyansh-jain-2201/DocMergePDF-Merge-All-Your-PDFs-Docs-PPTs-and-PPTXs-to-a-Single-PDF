# DocMergePDF-Merge-All-Your-PDFs-Docs-PPTs-and-PPTXs-to-a-Single-PDF
The repo is a Python project that allows users to merge multiple PDFs, Word documents, and PowerPoint presentations into a single PDF file. Users can simply move the files they want to merge to the current directory, optionally rename them, and then run the program.
